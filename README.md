# :warning: This repository is obsolete :warning:

[Microscopium](https://github.com/microscopium/microscopium) now features its own Bokeh-powered UI.

The content below is preserved for future reference.

# Microscopium User Interface

The web interface for [Microscopium](https://github.com/microscopium/microscopium).

Prerequisites
-------------

* Python 3.4
* NPM package manager
* Bower package manager
* MongoDB version > 2.6
* A modern browser. The interface is tested as working on 
    latest Chrome, Firefox, Edge and IE11. Due to the heavy use of the HTML5Canvas API,
    performance is best on Chrome.

Install Instructions (Development)
----------------------------------

Install Python package dependencies.

```console
$ pip install -r path/to/requirements.txt
```

Install JavaScript dependencies using NPM and Bower.

```console
$ npm install
$ bower install
```

Run grunt. The grunt tasks browserifies, lints and tests the JavaScript code upon any changes.

```console
$ grunt
```

If you don't have the `grunt` command in your path, you can install it
with:

```console
$ sudo npm install -g grunt-cli
```

Run the Flask server.

```console
$ python manage.py runserver -r
```

The interface will now be available in ``localhost:5000``. The port can be changed using the ``-p``
flag when using ``runserver``, e.ge

```console
$ python manage.py runserver -r -p 8080
```

MongoDB Schema
--------------

Documents should by default be stored in the the database ``microscopium``,
however this can be changed by updating the ``config.py`` file.

### Document Schemas ###

While MongoDB does not enforce a schema for data, certain fields must be present in
each document to ensure proper operation of the UI.

Screen descriptions are saved in the ``screens`` collection with the
following format:

```
var Screen = {
    _id: String, // A short ID for the screen.
    screen_desc: String, // A description of the screen.
    number_samples: Number, // The number of
    screen_features: Array, // An array of strings labelling each feature used in
                           // the screen.
    available_overlays: Array // An optional field. An array of additional overlay
                              // information available for samples in this screen.
                              // e.g. if samples have ``screen_run`` and ``z_score``
                              // overlay information, this array should be 
                              // ["screen_run", "z_score"]
}
```

Each sample saved in document with format:

```
var Sample = {
        _id: String,  // A unique identifier for each sample. Currently takes
                      // screen_id-plate-well
        screen: String  // The screen_id for the sample. An index should be
                        // setup on this field.
        gene_name: String,  // The name of the gene silenced or treatment
                            // applied to the sample.
        feature_vector: Array,  // An array of Numbers, the vector of
                                // unstandardised features
        feature_vector_std: Array  // An array of Numbers, the vector of standardised
                                   // features.
        neighbours: Array  // An array of sample_id strings, the 25 nearest
                           // neighbours of the sample.
        column: String,  // The column the sample is on in the plate
                         // e.g. '01', '02', '03', etc.
        row: String, // The row the sample is on in the plate
                     // e.g. 'A', 'B', 'C', etc.
        dimension_reduce: {
            pca: Array // the co-ordinates for the sample's point after PCA dimension reduction
            tsne: Array // the co-ordinates for the sample's point after TSNE dimension reduction
        },
        overlays: Object // An object of the additional screen overlay information
                         // for this sample. This information is optional. If no 
                         // overlay information is available, the corresponding
                         // sample document should no, or an empty, ``available_overlays``
                         // field. Currently supports numeric and Date data.
    }
```

Each image saved in document with format:

```
var Image = {
        _id: ObjectID, // Mongo generated unique ID for this image
        sample_id: String, // The _id of the sample corresponding to this image.
        image_full: String, // The fullsize image.
        image_large: String, // A large preview image, 512px wide.
        image_thumb: String // A smalller, thumbnail sized preview image, 150px wide.
    }
```

For each feature belonging to each screen, a document is saved detailing the feature
across the whole dataset. Think of this is the column axis if you were to look at the
dataset as a dataframe or table.

```
var Feature = {
        _id: ObjectID, // Mongo generated unique ID for this feature.
        screen: String,
        feature_name: String, // the actual name of the feature
        feature_dist: Array, // A vector of unstandardised values for this feature.
        feature_dist_std: Array, // A vector of standardised values for this feature.
}
```
### Indices ###

By default, MongoDB only creates indices on the primary key for each document.
The UI makes queries to a few non-primary keys, so indices need to be created on these.
From your Mongo terminal, load up the ``microscopium`` database and enter these commands
to ensure you've got the right indices.

```
db.samples.createIndex({'screen':1});
db.images.createIndex({'sample_id':1});
db.features.createIndex({'screen':1, 'feature_name':1});
```
